The network layer conducts DSWA calculations to determine averaging intervals and sliding factor, and makes GradedT update to get rate selection indexes. \r\n2. On the device layer, it is driven by transmitting and receiving events that execute PDR computation and RSS averaging respectively. The rate indexes are also selected on device layer according to results of network layer when the PDR or RSS is lower than transmission threshold.\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n1. **data**: measured data including packet loss rate, packet failed rate, received signal strength, etc.\r\n2. **DSWA**: dynamic sliding window averaging\r\n3. **gnuplot**: demos of gnuplot of experimental results\r\n4. **pktinfo**: packet delivery measurement source files based on _ath9k_\r\n\r\n## How to\r\n\r\n### For **DSWA**\r\n1. `cd DSWA`\r\n2. `sudo make`\r\n3. `sudo DSWA`\r\n\r\n### For **pktinfo**\r\n1. make sure the device information in _common.h_ is exactly what you are going to track\r\n2. `cd pktinfo`\r\n3. `sudo make`\r\n4. `sudo pktinfo`\r\n### For **gnuplot**\r\n\r\n1. make sure the experimental results and _time.plt_ are in the same folder\r\n2. `gnuplot`\r\n3. `load time.plt`","google":""}
